This is a command-line tool that makes [AppMaker][] components easier
to develop.

## Requirements

You will need node, npm, and mongodb running.

## Quick Start

```
sudo npm install -g appchef
mkdir my-component
cd my-component
appchef init
appchef serve
```

At this point you can visit http://localhost:5000 and your 
component should be listed. You can edit the `component.html` file in
`my-component` and reload the page to see your changes.
